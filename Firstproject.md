# WHAT IS CHATGPT 
Chatgpt is an artificial intelligence chatbox that is a natural language processing tool. Itâ€™s a model designed to assist with creating great ideas, breaking down complex works, write articles, code, write emails, process information and messages like humans. 
The first version of it was launched in November 2022, ChatGPT offers numerous features that makes it a captivating platform to be on. ChatGPT uses deep learning -- a subset of machine learning -- to produce humanlike text through transformer neural networks. The transformer predicts text, including the next word, sentence or paragraph, based on its training data's typical sequence.
GPT was developed by OpenAI and has been used in a variety of natural language processing applications such as language translation, text completion, and text summarization. This allows GPT to generate text that is not only coherent but also contextually appropriate. In chat applications, GPT can be used to generate chatbot responses that are indistinguishable from those of a human user, providing a more natural and personalized chat experience.

# BENEFITS OF CHATGPT 

As a technical writer, using chatGPT can help writers 

* Save time by generating great content for technical documentation, user manuals, FAQs, and other types of technical writing, fast and efficiently.

* Research new topics for technical articles and get information about the topic you're researching on.

* Translation of technical concepts by making them easier to read and understand because they can be complex and hard to read through.

* Aiding writer's block and an excellent tool for SEO content.

* Proof Reading and Editing: Chatgpt can help proofread, edit articles and writeups made by individuals, and check errors.

# HOW TO USE CHATGPT TO STREAMLINE AN EFFECTIVE CODING WORKFLOW.
You may increase productivity and get help with coding-related activities by streamlining your coding workflow with ChatGPT. Here are some pointers for using ChatGPT to its full potential:

* Creation of Code Snippet:
A code snippet is a little piece of reused source code, machine code, or text in programming. For a variety of programming languages and frameworks, ChatGPT can produce code snippets, use ChatGPT to generate code snippets or get advice on how to make your code better if you're writing new code. This can help you write better code and save you a ton of time and effort.

* Code review and debugging assistance: 
You can ask ChatGPT for assistance if you run into a problem. For instance, you may ask ChatGPT to develop a piece of code that fixes the issue, or you could ask ChatGPT for advice on how to resolve the issue. To gather feedback and uncover potential problems, send ChatGPT some code samples or particular portions. Describe the issue you're having or seek debugging assistance. ChatGPT can help find mistakes, recommend changes, or offer instructions on how to fix that particular bug.

* User Assistance and Support: 
Chatgpt can help in creating automated responses to client's queries and assistance. It would help in assisting users with syntax and language issues. Checkmate errors, It can review code snippets, identify potential improvements, suggest best practices, and provide optimization tips to enhance the code's efficiency and readability.

* Syntax assistance and providing technical documentation:
ChatGPT can provide quick references or examples if you're unclear about the proper syntax or how to utilize a particular function or library. For instance, you can ask ChatGPT to deliver an overview of a technical idea if you are working on a new project and need to understand it better. This might assist you in getting up to speed quickly and preventing errors.

# LIMITATION OF USING CHATGPT FOR CODING WORKFLOW 

* lack of comprehension of the context:
ChatGPT might find it hard understanding the context of what you want it to give you as output. Due to this, it may find it difficult to keep track of context and recall earlier discussions or snippets of code, which is essential for an effective coding workflow.

* Multitasking 
ChatGPT can not multi-task like humans, it can only take one input at a time, and it uses that input to determine the response. It doesn't proactively maintain a thorough awareness of the conversation's history or context throughout several turns. For a response, it instead depends on the messages that came right before. Therefore, the model is incapable of managing and addressing numerous ongoing tasks or topics at once due to a lack of built-in multitasking functionality.

* Restricted knowledge:
ChatGPT can only give limited knowledge about the input you ask from it. Although it has access to a large amount of knowledge but it can't to compared to that of a human. It may not be able to answer complex coding quieres.

* Biased Response:
 Due to the fact that ChatGPT was trained on a large dataset of text which means AI can produce biased response which stands the risk of losing consumers who feel unsafe with the output 

# CONCLUSION

Though ChatGPT might offer useful advice, it's important to analyze and verify any recommendations or code snippets it generates. When putting ChatGPT's guidance into practice, be cautious and thoughtful, and review the code twice for security and accuracy. You may streamline your coding processes, increase productivity, and improve your general programming skills by utilizing ChatGPT successfully.
While ChatGPT can not replace technical writers, it can help ease tedious tasks and help generate code snippets which would make technical writers use their skills to produce more beautiful results.
